# Lumberjerk keyboard by Gvalch'ca

The design is inspired by Lumberjack PCB. It is designed by peej and available at this repo:

## About the PCB

Lumberjerk is designed for Alps SKCL/SKCM and NMB Hi-Tek 725 "Space Invaders" switches. It is a 6x5 "split" with exposed components in between the halves.

Form-factor of the PCB is standard 60% (GH60-compatible). Two middle posts are removed though (but who cares?). Also the posts between Tab & Q and ] & \ are partially covered with the switches and it might be difficult to screw them. If you use SI switches, you'll also need to remove one switch leg in order to use these posts.

The PCB is designed to be used with BLE pro-micro compatible controller (e.g. nice!nano). Wired controller could be used too. In this case you'll need to solder JST connector and USB mini B (bottom mount) and connect your controller to the internal JST.

Also, there is second JST connector on the bottom of the board. It is meant to be used with daughterboard. OFC it requires you to use the same method with internal USB->JST cable.
